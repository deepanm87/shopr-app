This project is  a customizable e-commerce store with a Sanity backend that allows users to add products with details of the product name, description, price, quantity of stock, and a picture. We can add items to the basket, increase and decrease quantity, and also complete a dummy checkout via stripe payments and view orders created in the app. It also supports authentication using Clerk API.


This is the main home page with a header, search bar, basket and orders.
